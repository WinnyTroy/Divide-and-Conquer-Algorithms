# Divide-and-Conquer-Algorithms
An implementation of divide and conquer algorithms using python.


Divide-and-conquer is a top-down technique for designing algorithms that consists of dividing the problem into smaller subproblems hoping that the solutions of the subproblems are easier to find and then composing the partial solutions into the solution of the original problem.  

What do you mean by divide and conquer strategy?

A divide and conquer strategy, also known as “divide and rule strategy” is often applied in the arenas of politics and sociology. In this strategy, one power breaks another power into smaller, more manageable pieces, and then takes control of those pieces one by one.
